# Internet Explained

**The OmniScience of How the Network of Networks Actually Works.**

This repository is the inaugural, in-depth domain of the [OmniScience Project](https://github.com/Billy-2023/OmniScience-Framework). Our goal is not to list facts, but to build a **coherent, deep, and navigable understanding** of the Internet—from the physics of a single bit to the societal impact of a global platform.

## The Structure of Understanding

We break down the Internet into six interconnected layers of understanding:

1.  **[Core Concepts](./01-Core-Concepts/)** - The fundamental ideas (packet switching, TCP/IP) that make the Internet possible.
2.  **[Infrastructure](./02-Infrastructure/)** - The physical and logical fabric (cables, routers, BGP, data centers) that makes it real.
3.  **[History & Narrative](./03-History-Narrative/)** - The people, projects, and turning points that shaped its evolution.
4.  **[Society & Economy](./04-Society-Economy/)** - How the Internet transforms culture, commerce, and power structures.
5.  **[Security & Privacy](./05-Security-Privacy/)** - The perpetual arms race of attack, defense, and the right to be unseen.
6.  **[Future Frontiers](./06-Future-Frontiers/)** - Emerging challenges and paradigms (IoT, Web3, post-quantum cryptography).

## Current Status: Genesis

🚧 **This repository is in its Genesis Phase.** 🚧

The structure is ready. The first article, **[Packet Switching](./01-Core-Concepts/01-packet-switching.md)**, awaits its foundational content. This is where the journey begins.

## How to Navigate & Contribute

*   **Readers**: Start with the [Core Concepts](./01-Core-Concepts/). Follow the narrative path.
